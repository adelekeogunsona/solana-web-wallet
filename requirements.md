# Solana Multi-Wallet Web Application PRD
## CLIENT-ONLY IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Executive Summary

The Solana Multi-Wallet Application is a fully client-side, browser-based application built with React that allows users to manage multiple Solana wallets without relying on any backend server. All sensitive wallet data (private keys and seed phrases) will be stored locally in the user's browser with strong encryption, ensuring maximum security and privacy. This approach eliminates server-side security risks and provides users with complete control over their wallet data.

---

### 2. Product Vision

A lightweight, secure, and accessible browser-based application that enables users to view and manage multiple Solana wallets with minimal friction, focusing on speed and simplicity, while keeping all cryptographic secrets exclusively on the client side.

---

### 3. Core Architecture Principles

- **No Backend Server**: All application logic runs entirely in the browser
- **No Remote Storage**: All wallet data stored exclusively in the user's browser
- **Local Encryption**: Strong client-side encryption for all sensitive data
- **Offline Capability**: Core functionality works without internet (except for blockchain queries)
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable on supported devices with offline functionality
