# Solana Multi-Wallet Web Application

A secure, fully client-side Solana wallet application built with React and TypeScript. Manage multiple Solana wallets without relying on any backend server - all sensitive data stays on your device with strong encryption.

## üîê Security Features

- **Client-Side Only**: No backend servers, all operations run in your browser
- **Strong Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for all sensitive data
- **Local Storage**: Private keys and seed phrases never leave your device
- **Auto-Logout**: Configurable session timeout for enhanced security
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory when not in use

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Wallet Management**: Import and manage multiple Solana wallets
- **Balance Tracking**: View SOL and SPL token balances in real-time
- **Token Support**: Display all SPL tokens with metadata and logos
- **Send/Receive**: Complete transaction functionality with fee estimation
- **QR Codes**: Generate QR codes for easy address sharing
- **Transaction History**: View and track all wallet transactions
- **Progressive Web App**: Install as an app with offline capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern browser with Web Crypto API support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd solana-web-wallet
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Icons**: Heroicons and Lucide React
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for efficient form handling
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Blockchain**: Solana Web3.js and SPL Token libraries
- **Cryptography**: Web Crypto API for encryption

## üîß Configuration

### RPC Endpoints

The application connects to Solana RPC nodes for blockchain data. You can configure custom RPC endpoints in the Settings page:

- Default endpoints are provided for Mainnet, Testnet, and Devnet
- Support for custom RPC endpoints
- Automatic failover between multiple endpoints
- Health checking and performance monitoring

### Security Settings

- **Auto-logout Duration**: Configurable session timeout (default: 15 minutes)
- **PIN Authentication**: 6-digit PIN for wallet access
- **Backup Options**: Export encrypted wallet data for backup

## üì± Progressive Web App

This application can be installed as a PWA on supported devices:

1. Visit the application in a supported browser
2. Click the "Install" prompt or use browser's install option
3. The app will be available offline for cached operations

## üîí Security Architecture

### Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random numbers
- **Salt & IV**: Unique salt and initialization vector per operation

### Data Storage

- **Sensitive Data**: Encrypted and stored locally in browser storage
- **Session Management**: Temporary session keys with configurable expiration
- **Memory Handling**: Automatic cleanup of sensitive data from memory

### Privacy

- **No Tracking**: No analytics or tracking of user activity
- **No Servers**: All data processing happens client-side
- **No Network Transmission**: Private keys never transmitted over network
